# atlas-provider-hibernate

Load [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/orm/) schemas into an [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io) project.

## Use-cases
1. **Declarative migrations** - use a Terraform-like `atlas schema apply` to apply your Hibernate schema to the database.
2. **Automatic migration planning** - use `atlas migrate diff` to automatically plan a migration from  
   the current database version to the schema declared by the code.

## Installation

Install Atlas from macOS or Linux by running:
```bash
curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh
```
See [atlasgo.io](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#installation) for more installation options.

### Gradle

Add the provider to your gradle project:
```kotlin
plugins {
   id("io.atlasgo.hibernate-provider") version "0.1"
}
```

This plugin adds a task named `schema` to the project. Running this task will print the schema generated by 
Hibernate using entities and configurations taken from the runtime classpath.

The task implements the `JavaExec` task and the plugin does not make any configuration or dependency changes to the project.

Let's check that the task works by running the following command: 

```shell
./gradlew -q schema
```

## Configuration

By default, the task is configured to scan the entire `runtimeClasspath` configuration and look for Jakarta (JPA) entities.
The task does not require a database connection, but it does need to configure Hibernate with a specific database dialect.
There are several flags and hooks you can use to configure how Hibernate is being initialized inside the task, we will explore these later.

### Basic setup

In your project directory, create a new file named `atlas.hcl` with the following contents:

```hcl
data "external_schema" "hibernate" {
  program = [
      "./gradlew", 
      "-q",
      "schema"
   ]
}

env "hibernate" {
  url = data.external_schema.hibernate.url
  dev = "docker://mysql/8/dev"
}
```

Let's test this configuration, running the following command should generate the database schema in HCL format:
```shell
atlas schema inspect --env hibernate
```

### Choosing the dialect

If you would like to use a different database dialect, you need to make some changes:

1. Get Hibernate to initialize using the specific dialect. You can do that by changing the properties file (typically `hibernate.properties`), 
or by specifying an override properties file using `./gradlew -q schema --properties other.properties`.
2. Update the `external_schema` section in the `atlas.hcl` file
3. Update the `dev` property inside the `hibernate` to use a different [dev database](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/dev-database)

For example, for PostgreSQL:
- defining `jakarta.persistence.database-product-name=PostgreSQL` property and
- defining `docker://postgres/15/dev?search_path=public` as atlas dev database

### Flags
The schema task supports the following flags:

* `packages` - List of package names (for example `org.example.myservice.model`). If specified, 
only classes inside these packages will be considered during the entity scan. Given packages must be part of the classpath
* `classes` - List of classes that will be added to the entity scan explicitly. Ignores the `packages` argument.
* `properties` - Name of a properties file used to override the default properties read by Hibernate.
* `registry-builder` - FQDN of a class that implements `java.util.Function.Function<java.util.Properties, org.hibernate.service.ServiceRegistry>`.
Used when you need to override the default `ServiceRegistry` initialized by the task. Useful if you have a custom initialization process for Hibernate.
The properties parameter is the default settings used by the plugin, including ones read from the `properties` parameter.
* `metadata-builder` - FQDN of a class that implements `java.util.Function.Function<org.hibernate.service.ServiceRegistry, org.hibernate.boot.Metadata>`.
Used when you need to override the default `Metadata` used by the task. mutually exclusive with `packages` and `classes` arguments.  

### Usage

Once you have the provider installed, you can use it to apply your Hibernate schema to the database:

#### Apply

You can use the `atlas schema apply` command to plan and apply a migration of your database to
your current Hibernate schema. This works by inspecting the target database and comparing it to the
Hibernate schema and creating a migration plan. Atlas will prompt you to confirm the migration plan
before applying it to the database.

```bash
atlas schema apply --env hibernate -u "mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/mydb"
```
Where the `-u` flag accepts the [URL](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/url) to the
target database.

#### Diff

Atlas supports a [versioned migration](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned#versioned-migrations)
workflow, where each change to the database is versioned and recorded in a migration file. You can use the
`atlas migrate diff` command to automatically generate a migration file that will migrate the database
from its latest revision to the current Hibernate schema.

Add the following properties to `hibernate` environment section in `atlas.hcl`: 

```bash
env "hibernate" {
  ...
  src = data.external_schema.hibernate.url
  migration
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
}
```

Now run the `atlas migrate diff --env hibernate` command and observe the `migrations` directory.
